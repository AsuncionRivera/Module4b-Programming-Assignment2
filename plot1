#Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, 
#make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#You can read each of the two files using the readRDS() function in R. For example, reading in each file can be 
#done with the following code:
# This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
#NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
#SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

#Set working directory
