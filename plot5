#Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
#Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R 
#constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. 
#You must also include the code that creates the PNG file. Only include the code for a single plot (i.e. plot1.R should only include 
#code for producing plot1.png)
